/**
 *  The ZCRMailbox acts as a mediator in KVO notifications, taking a subscriber object and maintaining subscriptions to various notifier
 *  objects and their key paths.
 *
 *  A mailbox is created with a single "subscriber," which is stored weakly. Subscriptions can then be added to the mailbox, referencing
 *  a "notifier," which will publish KVO notifications, and a key-path for that notifier. Subscriptions can be removed using the various
 *  unsubscribe methods, or by simply deallocating the mailbox, which will automatically clean up any subscriptions that were made with it.
 *  Once a subscription is made, the notifier is strongly referenced by the mailbox until the subscription is removed.
 *
 *  While these objects are relatively lightweight, adding and removing subscriptions can be an expensive operation if performed recklessly,
 *  since they require locking of shared resources to ensure thread safety between all mailboxes. Therefore, they should typically be
 *  created and maintained for as long as possible.
 *
 *  ## Gotchas
 *
 *  A ZCRMailbox can maintain multiple notifiers and key-paths, but only one subscription for a single notifier and key-path. This means
 *  that the subscription methods cannot be successfully invoked with the same notifier and key-path, but different options or actions.
 *
 *  Because a mailbox only retains a weak reference to its subscriber, typically the subscriber will retain its mailbox. In such cases, it
 *  is very important to avoid retain cycles when using the block-based subscription methods. Referencing the subscriber in the block, which
 *  retains the mailbox, will result in the subscriber not being able to deallocate until the mailbox is manually nilled out.
 *
 *  ZCRMailboxes are guaranteed to execute and deliver ZCRMessages in a thread-safe manner, however no guarantee is made as to which thread
 *  these messages will be delivered on. Therefore, if UI changes are made in the subscription action, they should be dispatched onto the
 *  main thread or queue.
 *
 *  ## Subclassing Notes
 *
 *  It should not be necessary to subclass ZCRMailbox, unless additional validation of subscribers, notifiers, key-paths, etc. is necessary.
 *  Subclasses should invoke the super implementations when available to ensure the observations are properly created. This is because
 *  ZCRMailbox does not directly add KVO-observation, nor does it guarantee thread safety outside of adding and removing subscriptions.
